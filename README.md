# base-electron-boilerplate
This is my rendition of [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate). I looked at [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate) and I thought to myself, I could make it more organized and less bloated, so here it is so far.

This repo is very similar to [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate), but with some key differences. Some you might like, some you might not like.

## Differences
 * Main and renderer source files are split into two folders
 * There are no build files in the app folder
 * Main source files have auto reload with nodemon
 * Webpack configs are in a subdirectory
 * Did some cleanup all around
 * Added some flow types, like a State type
 * Updated the React component prop types
